# MachineLearning-Clustering-Principal-Component-Analysis-UnsupervisedLearning
Objective: 

Machine Learning - Unsupervised Learning - Clustering worldwide countries based on the economic norms and human life styles




Background:

Jupyter Notebook entitled in this repository pragmatic to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then suggesting countries to different NGO foundations to focus on the most direst help seeking countries.




Tasks performed:

1. Performing PCA on the dataset and to obtain the new dataset with the Principal Components. Chosing the appropriate number of components k. Needing to perform clustering activity on the new dataset, i.e. the PCA modified dataset with the k components.
2. Outlier Analysis
3. Trying both K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters
4. Anlysing the clusters and identifying the ones which are in dire need of aid. Anlysing the clusters by comparing how variables - [gdpp, child_mort and income] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.
5. Performing visualisations on the clusters that have been formed.  Plotting a scatter plot of all the countries and differentiating the clusters.
6. Identifying 5 countries needing help on urgent basis
